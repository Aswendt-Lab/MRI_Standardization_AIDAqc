# MRI_Standardization_AIDAqc
Small animal MRI Standardization initiative using [AIDAqc](https://github.com/Aswendt-Lab/AIDAqc)

## Aims
### Project #1: 
Retrospective, automated MRI quality control (QC) to exclude bad quality data automatically from a large pool of small animal datasets acquired in different international MRI labs/core facilities. 

### Project #2: 
Representative standard phantom measurements according to harmonized protocols to prove the importance of quality assurance (QA) procedures in each MRI lab as the basis for multicenter studies and cross-lab comparisons.
